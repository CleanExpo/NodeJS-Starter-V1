The starter template is self-contained and can be deployed to various platforms:

### Backend Deployment Options

## Notes

- These workflows are **optional** - the template works locally without any deployment
- Deployment workflows require external service accounts and API tokens
- The main CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs without any secrets
- For production deployments, ensure you:
  - Change JWT secret keys
  - Use proper database credentials
  - Configure environment variables
  - Set up proper monitoring and logging

## Self-Hosting

You can also self-host the entire stack using Docker:

```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build

# Or deploy to your own server
# See docs/DEPLOYMENT.md for details
```
