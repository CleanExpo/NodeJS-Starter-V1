"""Long-Running Agent Harness.

Enables agents to work effectively across many context windows by:
1. Setting up structured environment on first run (InitializerAgent)
2. Making incremental progress each session (CodingAgent)
3. Tracking progress with structured files (ProgressTracker)
4. Managing feature requirements (FeatureManager)

Reference: Anthropic Blog - "Effective harnesses for long-running agents"
https://www.anthropic.com/research/long-running-agents

Key Concepts:
- Each session starts by reading progress files and git history
- Work on ONE feature at a time
- Test features end-to-end before marking complete
- Leave environment in clean state with documentation

Usage:
    from src.agents.long_running import (
        LongRunningAgentHarness,
        SessionRunner,
    )

    # Option 1: Use the harness directly
    harness = LongRunningAgentHarness(
        project_path="/path/to/project",
        project_name="my-app",
        specification="Build a chat application",
    )
    result = await harness.run_session()

    # Option 2: Use SessionRunner for simpler API
    runner = SessionRunner("/path/to/project")
    result = await runner.run("Build a chat application")

    # Option 3: Run until complete (with caution!)
    results = await harness.run_until_complete(max_sessions=50)
