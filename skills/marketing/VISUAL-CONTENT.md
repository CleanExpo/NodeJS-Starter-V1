# Visual Content Creation Framework

Research-backed system for authentic visual content. Real > Stock > AI.

## Trust Hierarchy

| Tier | Type | Trust | Use |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Real Work Photos | 10/10 | Always - YOUR actual work |
| 2 | Video Testimonials | 9/10 | Highest converting |
| 3 | Behind-the-Scenes | 8/10 | Humanizes brand |
| 4 | Educational/How-To | 7/10 | Authority building |
| 5 | Designed Graphics | 5/10 | Info only |
| 6 | Stock Photography | 2/10 | Generic blogs ONLY |
| 7 | AI Generated | 1/10 | Abstract ONLY, never people |

## Critical Rules

1. **Capture BEFORE unpacking tools** - 30 seconds, 3 angles
2. **NEVER use AI for people or work** - Destroys trust
3. **Audio > Video quality** - People forgive bad video, not bad audio
4. **3x weekly posting** - 2.5X more leads vs occasional
5. **Batch monthly** - 2-hour session = 4-6 weeks content

## Video Quick Reference

| Type | Difficulty | Time | Platform |
|------|------------|------|----------|
| Quick Tips | ★☆☆☆☆ | 5-10 min | TikTok, Reels |
| Before/After | ★★☆☆☆ | 10-20 min | Instagram |
| Testimonial | ★★★☆☆ | 30-60 min | Website |
| How-To | ★★★★☆ | 2-4 hrs | YouTube |

## Photo Capture Triggers

**Arrival:** Wide shot, close-up, context (BEFORE tools)
**Completion:** Same angles as before, finished details, happy client

## Image Decision Tree

1. Shows YOUR work? → Must be real photo
2. Shows a person? → Must be real photo with permission
3. For testimonials/portfolio? → Must be real photo
4. Purely decorative? → AI/graphics acceptable
