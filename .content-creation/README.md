# Visual Content Creation Framework

> **The solution is NOT to remember better. The solution is to make it automatic.**

## The Problem

Most tradies know they need visual content but face barriers:
- "I'm a plumber, not a photographer"
- "I don't have time to learn all this stuff"
- "Stock photos look fake and everyone uses them"
- "AI images have six fingers and look creepy"

## The Solution

A research-backed system that makes authentic content creation automatic.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Week 1: Minimum Viable Content
Day 1: Take before/after photos of ONE job
Day 2: Post as carousel on Facebook/Instagram
Day 3: Ask ONE happy customer for video testimonial
Day 4: Record ONE 30-second tip video
Day 5: Post the testimonial
```

## Trust Hierarchy

| Tier | Type | Trust | When to Use |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Real Work Photos | 10/10 | Always |
| 2 | Video Testimonials | 9/10 | Sales, website |
| 3 | Behind-the-Scenes | 8/10 | Social media |
| 4 | Educational | 7/10 | YouTube, authority |
| 5 | Graphics | 5/10 | Info only |
| 6 | Stock Photos | 2/10 | Generic blogs ONLY |
| 7 | AI Generated | 1/10 | Abstract ONLY |

## Critical Rules

1. **Capture BEFORE tools** - Phone out first, 30 seconds
2. **Real > Stock > AI** - Always
3. **NEVER AI for people/work** - Destroys trust when detected
4. **3x weekly posting** - Consistency > perfection
5. **Batch monthly** - 2 hours = 4-6 weeks content
