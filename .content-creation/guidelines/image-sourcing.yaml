# Image Sourcing Guidelines
# Decision framework for choosing image sources

version: "1.0"
principle: "Real > Stock > AI. Always."

decision_framework:
  step_1:
    question: "Does this image represent YOUR actual work?"
    if_yes: "MUST be real photo - no exceptions"
    if_no: "Continue to step 2"

  step_2:
    question: "Does this image show a person?"
    if_yes: "MUST be real photo of real person with permission"
    if_no: "Continue to step 3"

  step_3:
    question: "Will customers use this to judge your credibility?"
    if_yes: "MUST be real photo"
    if_no: "Continue to step 4"

  step_4:
    question: "Is this for testimonials, portfolio, or about pages?"
    if_yes: "MUST be real photo"
    if_no: "Continue to step 5"

  step_5:
    question: "Is this purely decorative/conceptual?"
    if_yes: "AI or designed graphics acceptable"
    if_no: "Default to real photo"

mandatory_real_photos:
  team_photos:
    why: "Customers want to know who's coming to their home"
    requirements:
      - "Actual team members"
      - "Clear, well-lit faces"
      - "Professional but authentic"
      - "Updated when team changes"
    never:
      - "Stock photos of workers"
      - "AI-generated faces"
      - "Photos without permission"

  project_portfolio:
    why: "This IS your proof of capability"
    requirements:
      - "Your actual completed work"
      - "Before AND after shots"
      - "Consistent angles for comparison"
      - "High resolution for detail"
    never:
      - "Stock photos of similar work"
      - "AI-generated project images"
      - "Competitor's work"

  testimonials:
    why: "Trust requires authenticity"
    requirements:
      - "Real customer (with permission)"
      - "Ideally in front of completed work"
      - "Name and suburb (if permitted)"
    alternatives_if_no_photo:
      - "Text-only testimonial with full name"
      - "Video testimonial"
      - "Google review screenshot"
    never:
      - "Stock photo of happy customer"
      - "AI-generated person"
      - "Anonymous testimonial with generic image"

ai_detection_risks:
  common_tells:
    - "Wrong number of fingers (3, 4, 6, 7)"
    - "Asymmetrical faces/eyes"
    - "Unnaturally smooth skin"
    - "Incoherent text/signage"
    - "Lighting from multiple directions"
    - "Melted/merged background elements"
    - "Over-glossy surfaces"
    - "Impossible reflections"

  why_it_matters: |
    Even when not detected, AI images lack 'the spark of life' that real photos have.
    Research shows customers perceive them as impersonal, less professional, and lacking credibility.

  case_study:
    incident: "Queensland Symphony Orchestra (Feb 2024)"
    what_happened: "Posted AI-generated advertisement showing couple in concert hall"
    issues: "Odd hand proportions, disjointed clothing, unsettling facial expressions"
    response: "Media called it 'worst AI generated artwork they've seen'"
    lesson: "AI images can generate public backlash and damage reputation"

anti_patterns:
  stock_testimonials:
    problem: "Stock photo + real quote"
    result: "Trust completely destroyed"
    fix: "Text-only or get real customer photo"

  ai_team_photos:
    problem: "AI-generated headshots"
    result: "Uncanny valley, anatomical errors"
    fix: "Take real photos of real team"

  generic_portfolio:
    problem: "Stock images of 'similar work'"
    result: "Customers expect YOUR work"
    fix: "Only show YOUR completed projects"
